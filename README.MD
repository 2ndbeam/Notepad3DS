# Notepad3DS
Text editor for the Nintendo 3DS console.  

## Features
File opening/saving  
Search for terms in a file  
Jump to beginning/end of a file  


## Usage
Instructions are provided on the bottom screen of the 3DS  
The bottom screen is also used to show information about the file and some error messages (file opening failure for example)  
Running Notepad3DS through the Homebrew Launcher will mean all file saves/opens will start from the /3ds/ directory. Prefix '../' to your filename to access the root folder.  
Running Notepad3DS through a .cia will mean all file saves/opens will start from the root '/' directory. You can access files in other directories from here. For example, 3ds/files/example.txt   

__NOTE:__ Notepad3DS can access directories but cannot create them. Saving a file to a non existing directory will __NOT__ save the file correctly.
